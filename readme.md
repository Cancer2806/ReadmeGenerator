## Installation Notes  

  Fork from Github and retain the directory structure.  Node must be installed on your computer.   


## Usage 

  Ensure you are in the correct directory (Develop) and using your preferred terminal interface, type 'node index.js' at the command line.  You will be asked a series of questions specifically about the repository for which you are generating a Readme file.   If any section is not applicable to your project, then just press 'Enter' to move onto the next question.  The Readme file will not include any section for which no text has been entered, as it will assume those sections are not required (with the exception of Questions and Licenses which are always included).   Once all of the questions have been answered, the Readme file will be generated in the parent directory to 'Develop'.  If a Readme file already exists in this location, it will be overwritten.   Simply copy the Readme file to the appropriate repository folder and push to Github.  Of course, feel free to make any final edits, such as the inclusion of screenshots, etc.  The repository for this application can be found at https://github.com/Cancer2806/ReadmeGenerator   


## Features
