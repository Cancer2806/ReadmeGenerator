## Installation Notes  

  Fork from Github and retain the directory structure.  Node must be installed on your computer.  


## Usage 

  Ensure you are in the correct directory (Develop) and using your preferred terminal, type 'node index.js'.  You will be asked a series of questions specifically about the repository for which you are generating a Readme file.  If any section is not applicable to your project, then just press 'Enter' to move onto the next question. If no text is entered, the section will not be included in the Readme file (with the exception of Questions and Licenses which are always included).  Once all of the questions have been answered, the Readme file will be generated in the parent directory to 'Develop'.  Simply copy the Readme file to the appropriate repository folder and push to Github.  Feel free to make any final edits, such as the inclusion of screenshots, etc.  


## Features  

  Generation of the badges, and inclusion of only the sections relevant to your app are considered features
