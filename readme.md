## Installation Notes  

  Fork from Github and retain the directory structure.  



## Usage 

  Ensure you are in the "Develop" directory and type node index.js in your terminal of choice.  Questions will be displayed in the terminal.  Answer the questions that are relevant to your project.  If a section is not relevant to your Project, then just press enter and move onto the next question. The Readme file will be generated in the parent directory (Readme Generator).  Finalise the editing and post to your Github.
